# Shell commands in xv6

This is a fork of https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public.git.

1. Enhanced the shell with a user authentication feature, where credentials are maintained in the Makefile.
2. Added new shell commands:
    1. history – displays previously executed commands along with their process IDs (pid).
    2. block/unblock – shell commands to manage system call blocking.
            "block x" command blocks system call with system call number x. (system call numbers are defined in syscall.h)
    3. chmod – modifies file permissions.
            "chmod file mode" changes the permissions of file to mode.
                mode: 3-bit integer
                – bit 0: Allows the file to be read.
                – bit 1: Allows the file to be written.
                – bit 2: Allows execution..
