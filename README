# Shell commands in xv6

This is a fork of https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public.git.

1. Enhanced the shell with a user authentication feature, where credentials are maintained in the Makefile.
2. Added new shell commands:
    1. history – displays previously executed commands along with their process IDs (pid).
    2. block/unblock – shell commands to manage system call blocking.
    3. chmod – modifies file permissions.
